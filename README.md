### Mainboard-specific configuration files for lm-sensors

This repo contains sensor configuration for some of the motherboards I've
used. No extensive testing has been performed on any of the boards; if the
config "sort of works", it's good enough.

Following boards are included:

* [ASRock Q2900-ITX](asrock-q2900-itx.conf)
* [ASUS P8B75-M](asus-p8b75-m.conf)
* [ASUS Q87M-E](asus-q87m-e.conf)
* [Gigabyte H61M-S2PV](ga-h61m-s2pv.conf)
* [Intel DH61WW](intel-dh61ww.conf)
* [Intel DQ67SW](intel-dq67sw.conf)
* [Intel DQ77CP](intel-dq77cp.conf)
* [MSI Z77A-GD65](msi-z77a-gd65.conf)
